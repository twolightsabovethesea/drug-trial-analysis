# matplotlib_challenge

The project was done for the University of Pennsylvania Data Analytics Bootcamp. It was completed in Jupyter using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Data from a fictitious drug trial was cleaned, analyzed, and visualized using both Matplotlib and Pandas to reveal trends in the study outcomes for mice on 19 different drug regimens and a placebo group.  A brief written summary of three observations made about the data can be viewed in the top cell.
